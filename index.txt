<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>MPIR is a highly optimised library for bignum arithmetic forked from the
GMP bignum library. It is written in assembly language and C. It is currently 
maintained by <a href="mailto:goodwillhart {at_thingy} googlemail dot com">William Hart</a>.</p>

<p>The features of MPIR include:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSVC solution files for 32 and 64 bit Windows</li>
<li>64 bit inputs to all high level (_si and _ui) functions on Windows 64</li>
<li>Superoptimised assembly sequences for x86_64 hardware</li>
<li>Very fast Schoenhage-Strassen implementation for large integer products</li>
<li>Improved divide-and-conquer division</li>
<li>Many other algorithmic and coding tricks</li>
</ul>

<p>MPIR is licensed <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html">LGPL v3+</a>.</p>

<p>MPIR is written in ANSI C and assembly language and runs on many platforms 
(including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows on common hardware configurations),
but is currently mostly optimised for x86 and x86-64 CPUs. It is designed to 
be threadsafe.</p>
